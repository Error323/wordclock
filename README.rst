Wordclock
=========

This is the sourcecode to an Arduino based wordclock. There exist many of these
wordclocks on the internet, or even on github. But this one is somewhat special
as it also encodes names of people's birthdays.

Hardware
--------

- Atmega328p
- DCF77 receiver
- Neopixel ledstrip (60 leds/meter)
